### Azure Models
#### Q: What's the differences between different cloud models: PaaS, IaaS, SaaS?
A:<br/>
**1) PaaS: Platform As A Service** - in that model user doesn't have to care about platform settings, access to OS, OS configuration, Web Service configuration etc. Such information are totally transparent to him. Only what he needs to know is how to deploy an application to the particular "platform". In Azure PaaS examples are: Azure CDN, Azure Search, App Service. In PaaS model:
- Client is responsible on: Data, Application
- Cloud provider is responsible on: Runtime, Middleware, OS, Servers, Virtualizations, Storage, Networking<br/>
**2) IaaS: Infrastructure As A Service** - IaaS "hide" internal communications betwen objects as: Network, Antivirus, Operating System, Clusters etc. Examples: Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service. User doesn't have influence how network looks like and which HW/SW components are choosen to build infrastructure<br/>
In IaaS model:
- Client is responsible on: Data, Application, Runtime, Middleware, OS
- Cloud provider is responsible on: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
**3) SaaS: Software As A Service** - delivers full software platform and/or SDK Suite for developers. Only what the user needs to do is to make a configuration. Scalability & platform is transparent. Example: Office 356, Azure IoT Suite
In SaaS model client is responsible on Data only, the rest of Cloud Stack is in Cloud provider's responsibility

### Storage Account
#### Q: How many different Storage Accounts Azure offer?
A: There's 4 types of Storage Accounts:<br/>  
**1) BLOB Storage** - designed for storing images, files with distributed access, logs etc.<br/>
**2) Table Storage** - designed for storing structured NoSQL data.<br/>
**3) Queue Storage** - designerd for storing large number of messages (access via HTTPS).<br/> 
**4) (Shared) File Storage** - designed for storing fully managed file shares.<br/>
#### Q: What's Shared Access Signature?
A: SAS is a hash key including into Storage Account/Container/Blob URI that guaarantees restricted access to that objects. SAS can be generated with validity period (for example for 1 month only)
#### Q: How much storage VM can use?
A: Data Disk contains up to 1 TB free space, however it's possible to link more than one disk to the VM
#### Q: Is there any limit of file count on BLOB Storage?
A: There's no limit on file count however there's a limit on storage size (500TB). 
#### Q: What's Storage Account Soft Delete?
A: Soft delete protects file against accidentially deletion. When the option is enabled and user performs delete on particular object, Azure marked it as "Deleted" without phisically removal.

<a name="key_vault"></a>

#### Q: What kind of secrets Azure Key Vault can protect?
A: Keys, Certificates and Secrets

#### Q: How can you grant access to e.g. list secrets/certificates?

### Identity
#### Q: What's Identity As A Service in Microsoft Azure?
A: It's SaaS-based Identity Access Management (IAM) that allows to use Single Sign-On authentication from your organization (on-premises AD) and access control

#### Q: What's a different way to create identity in Azure AD?
A: It can be: adding user in Azure AD, invite user via Azure AD (hardening), Synchronization with on-prem AD, Azure AD Bulk create/Bulk invite (group of users defined in *.csv file),

A: Azure AD connect is a tool that is able to sync users/groups/devices bewteen on-prem and cloud

#### Q: What's conditional access?
A: Conditional Access is the tool used by AAD to bring signals together to make decisions. For example access can be determined by some localization or device platform (iOS, Android etc)

### Roles
#### Q: Name the most popular available roles
A:
- Contributor - can manage everything except access
- Owner - can manage everything including access
- Reader - can view anything but can't make changes

- Virtual machine Contributor - can manage VMs but not virtual network or storage

#### Q: On which level it's possible to grant an access?
A: You can grant an access on Subscription, Resource Group and Resources level

<a name="zerotrust"></a>
### Zero Trust
#### Q: What's Zero Trust?
A: Zero Trust is a security model in organization, called "don't trust anyone". It contains with following items:
- strong identity authentication everywhere
- devices are enrolled in device management and their health is validated
- access is limited to only what is needed
- the health of services is validated

<a name="databox"></a>
## Azure Data Box
### Conception
#### Q: Describe conception of Azure Data Box in the context of backup and restore
A: Azure Data Box Service is used when you want to transfer large amount of data from on-premis to Cloud. Data Box is a physical device that can be ordered directly from Azure portal. Once the data are copied on the device, box is returned to the Azure Data Center to be uploaded to the cloud. After that action device is securely erased
